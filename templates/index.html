<p class="card-text">We cater to business and corporate community, high school or college students and all like-minded people that are driven to attain their fitness goals in an exclusive environment. Every square inch of our facility is dedicated to getting you ideally fit, strong, healthy and mentally tough to face the challenges of everyday life.</p>
<p>about 67% of people who have gym memberships never use them and of those who do go to the gym, average only around 2 times a week.
With that being said, you’re probably still wondering what I can say to convince you to get your ass in the gym. Well, don’t worry I’m about to outline 10 awesome reasons to go to the gym.
If my list here doesn’t get you moving and on track to a more healthy lifestyle, then I’m afraid you might be a lost cause…</p>

<h3><b>Reason #1: It’s plain healthy</b></h3>
<p>I’m just going to go ahead and state the obvious upfront:
Going to the gym is plain healthy (if you know what you are doing).
If you’re just starting and feel like you aren’t making progress, give yourself a pat on the back for at least making the effort.
Going to the gym is just the first step. The gym is a magical place, but it’s not mystical.
You can’t just sign up, walk in the gym and have the gym gods grant you a healthy body. However, as I just said, going to the gym puts you on the path to a healthy lifestyle and that’s what everyone’s end goal is (or should be).

It’s your path to success, you just have to work at it.

There’s no question that there is a direct correlation between healthy, active, individuals and gym going. It’s as simple as that.</p>

<h3><b>Reason #2: Feel better about yourself</b></h3>
<p> I don’t know about you, but I feel pretty damn good about myself after I leave the gym.
It just feels good to be healthy. I think this is one of the most important reasons to go to the gym.
A lot of people overlook this aspect of lifting and fitness.
If you look good, you are going to feel better about yourself.
It’s like a chain reaction:
You start lifting, you start to look better. When you start feeling better about the way you look, you’re going to gain confidence. A lot of confidence.
More importantly, though, this confidence you’re going to gain has direct real-world benefits.
It can help you in your relationships, your job, your friends and just your entire social life in general.
I’ve said before, fitness is a lifestyle and that is exactly what I mean.
When you feel better about yourself and you are living that healthy lifestyle, the rest of your life just “falls into place”.</p>
<h3><b>Reason #3: Great way to relieve stress</b></h3>
<p>
Does your 9 to 5 have you feeling down?
Well, hitting the gym is one of the best stress relievers there is.
For me, the gym is my getaway, it’s my place to forget everything that’s going on in my life and focus on myself.
So hit the gym, turn that phone off and do your body some good.
By treating your body right you’ll start to feel better mentally.
Suddenly after you’ve killed your workout for the day you’ll walk out of the gym with this euphoric feeling and feel like nothing can stop you.
All that stress you came to the gym with has likely disappeared.
It’s just like punching your pillow when you were a kid, only this time your throwing up weights and gaining some muscle mass.
You’ll work towards your goals and get rid of that annoying stress – sounds like a much better deal to me.
